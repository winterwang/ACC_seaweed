## Background (1)

.small[
- Iodine is an essential micronutrient that is oxidized to produce iodine-containing thyroid hormones. 

- Iodine deficiency has long been a recognized global public health problem, however, there was not much emphasis on the possible consequences of **iodine excess**. 

- The sources of excess iodine can be from 
  - iodized salt, ~~drinking water~~, ~~milk rich in iodine~~, seaweeds, and dietary supplements.
  
- Iodine excess can cause subclinical or overt thyroid dysfunction, and even thyroid (papillary) cancer.

- The recommended dietary allowance (RDA) for adults is 150 micrograms/day, 220 to 250 micrograms/day for pregnant women, and 250 to 290 micrograms/day for breastfeeding women.

- up to 1 mg/day is (probably) safe for most people

## Background (2)

.small[
- Thyroid cancer might have already become **the third leading cancer diagnosis** in the United States in women.

- Age-adjusted incidence rate in Japan (2016,  per 100,000 person-years): 
    - 5.7 in men
    - 16.7 in women

- However, the numbers may include substantial portions of "incidentally-detected" cases through health/cancer screenings. 

- The only mostly accepted risk factor for thyroid cancer is **radiation exposure**.
]

???

- Because the advance of computer tomography, ultrasonography and fine needle aspiration cytology has made it possible to detect small thyroid cancers.
