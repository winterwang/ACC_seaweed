# Background


---
class: middle

## Background (1)

.small[
- Iodine is an essential micronutrient that is oxidized to produce iodine-containing thyroid hormones. 

- Iodine deficiency has long been a recognized global public health problem, however, there was not much emphasis on the possible "consequences" of **iodine excess**. 

- The sources of excess iodine can be from 
  - iodized salt, ~~drinking water~~, ~~milk rich in iodine~~, seaweeds, and dietary supplements.
  
- Iodine excess can cause subclinical or overt thyroid dysfunction, and even thyroid (papillary) cancer.
]

???

- The recommended dietary allowance (RDA) for adults is 150 micrograms/day, 220 to 250 micrograms/day for pregnant women, and 250 to 290 micrograms/day for breastfeeding women.

- up to 1 mg/day is (probably) safe for most people

## Background (2)

.small[
- Thyroid cancer might have already become **the third leading cancer diagnosis** in the United States in women.

- Age-adjusted incidence rate in Japan (2016,  per 100,000 person-years): 
    - 5.7 in men
    - 16.7 in women

- However, the numbers may include substantial portions of "incidentally-detected" cases through health/cancer screenings. 

- The only mostly accepted risk factor for thyroid cancer is **radiation exposure**.
]

???

- Because the advance of computer tomography, ultrasonography and fine needle aspiration cytology has made it possible to detect small thyroid cancers.

???

- The incidence rate of thyroid cancer increased from about 2 to nearly 10 per 100,000 people in Japan over the past three decades. 
- However, mortality rates in both men and women stayed stable or slightly decreased.

- Global incidence seems to be higher in high-income countries compared with low-income and middle-income countries for both men and women.

- One meta analysis which included 16 observational studies reported higher thyroid cancer risk for people with high iodine exposure.

.footnote[
- This meta-analysis evaluated different types of iodine level and we can see there is no evidence for increased thyroid cancer risk in any kind of measurements. 
- Another problem in this study is that they **only included subjects in the highest and the lowest exposure groups**.
